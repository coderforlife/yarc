YARC: Yet Another Roomba Controller
===================================

This is a Python library that allows you to control Roomba's and Create's from iRobot using the serial connection. This requires Python 3 and the pyserial library. This can run on many devices such as Raspberry Pis and regular PCs.

This implements the Open Interface specification by iRobot: http://www.irobot.com/~/media/MainSite/PDFs/About/STEM/Create/create_2_Open_Interface_Spec.pdf

This library implements every single opcode in the specification and provides every single sensor in an easy-to-use system.

This can be installed from source from the Github page or through pip.


Example
-------

```python
import yarc

# Make the Roomba object
bot = yarc.Roomba('/dev/ttyUSB0')

# Start the OI connection - must be the first call
bot.start()

# Switch to 'safe' mode
# In this mode we can completely control the robot unless it 'senses danger'
# in which case it will switch back to 'passive' mode. Danger could be
# detection of a cliff, detection of a wheel drop, or charger plugged in.
bot.safe()

# Commands
bot.drive_distance(100) # drives 100 mm forward
bot.turn_angle(45) # rotates 45 degrees in-place
... # more instructions
print(bot.battery_charge / bot.battery_capacity) # print battery charge percent
print(bot.all_sensors) # print out all sensor data

# Stop the OI connection - must be the last call
bot.stop()
```
